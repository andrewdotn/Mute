Mute
====

A tiny app for Mac OS X (starting with 10.6 I think) that lets you toggle your Microphone from the Menu Bar with a single click

This is not quite what I wanted to create nor is it a really good solution. In reality, it's braindead and ugly as hell. But hey, at least I have a simple button in the upper right corner of my screen which somehow does something pretty close to what I wanted.

If someone wants to continue, these are the things I wanted to do:

* add a global shortcut which you could hold down to temporally mute your microphone
* run the app as an agent (well, totally possible already but it's even less usefull in the current state if you do so)
* add a fancy app icon

The status bar icon however is my own creation and under copyright. Don't steal that, ask me first.
